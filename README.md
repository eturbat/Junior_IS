# Junior_IS


###The project for my Junior IS will focus on designing and developing a customized learning management system (LMS) that addresses the unique needs of computer science students. The proposed LMS will be a web-based application that will provide students with a cen- tralized platform for accessing source codes, taking tests, and tracking their progress. The system will also include features such as interactive simulations, coding exercises, and collab- orative learning tools to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. By creating a user-friendly and centralized platform that includes interactive and collaborative features, the proposed LMS will help computer science students to better understand complex con- cepts, apply them to real-world problems and improve their critical thinking skills.
